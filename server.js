    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> This project is a space-themed Mad Lib game built using ExpressJS and front-end web technologies. The user fills out a creative form ‚Äî or uses random word generators ‚Äî to generate a unique adventure story set in space.</p>

    <p><strong>Technology Stack:</strong> The server is built with Node.js and ExpressJS to handle form submissions and generate dynamic HTML responses. Front-end logic uses vanilla JavaScript for interactivity, HTML for structure, and CSS for styling.</p>

    <p><strong>User Interface Theme:</strong> The UI was designed to feel immersive and futuristic, in line with the space adventure theme. A dark background with gradients mimics a starry void, and elements glow slightly with blue/cyan hues to give it a sci-fi energy vibe. Glassmorphism was used for form containers to create a "space screen" feel.</p>

    <p><strong>Font Choices:</strong> The font family selected was <code>Segoe UI</code> / <code>Tahoma</code> / <code>Verdana</code>, which are clean, readable sans-serif fonts that convey a modern and professional look while being web-safe. The goal was to make the text easy to read across devices, while fitting the theme without needing custom font libraries.</p>

    <p><strong>Interactive Features:</strong> Each form input includes a üé≤ button to auto-fill random space-themed words, encouraging exploration and fun. This was implemented using JavaScript and an in-memory word bank with 20+ options per field.</p>

    <p><strong>Validation:</strong> Server-side validation checks for missing input and returns a user-friendly error message if any field is empty. This ensures complete stories are always generated.</p>

    <p><strong>Deployment:</strong> The app runs locally using <code>node server.js local</code> and serves static files through Express. Pages are accessed via <code>localhost:8080/ITC505/lab-7/index.html</code>.</p>

    <p><strong>Learning Outcome:</strong> This lab strengthened my skills in ExpressJS, front-end interactivity, client-server data flow, and web design fundamentals. I also learned how to make user experience engaging by blending logic with fun UI touches.</p>

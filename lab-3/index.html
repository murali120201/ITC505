    <h1>Genghis Khan </h1>
    <img src="genghis-khan-.jpg" alt="Genghis" width="500" height="400">
    <h2>Founder and first Khan of Mongol Empire</h2>
    <p> Temüjin, later known as Genghis Khan, was born between 1155 and 1167 into a Mongol chieftain’s family. His early life was harsh—after his father’s death, his family was abandoned by their tribe, leaving them in poverty and struggle. To secure his place as leader, he made the difficult decision to kill his older half-brother.

        Despite these hardships, Temüjin’s charismatic leadership attracted loyal followers. He formed key alliances and successfully rescued his kidnapped wife, Börte. However, as his power grew, tensions with his former ally Jamukha led to war, where Temüjin suffered a major defeat in 1187. He spent years regaining strength and, by 1196, was rising as a dominant force.
        
        In 1203, his former ally Toghrul turned against him, forcing Temüjin to retreat. However, he regrouped, fought back, and emerged victorious. By defeating the Naiman tribe and executing Jamukha, he became the undisputed leader of the Mongolian steppe, setting the stage for his legendary conquests across China and Central Asia.</p>
    <p>Genghis Khan remains a complex and controversial figure. He was fiercely loyal to his followers but ruthless toward his enemies. Believing he was destined for conquest by the deity Tengri, he sought advice from diverse sources to expand his empire. His armies killed millions, yet his rule also encouraged trade and cultural exchange across vast regions.

        Views on him vary—Russia and the Arab world remember him as a brutal tyrant, while modern scholars reassess him beyond the image of a barbarian warlord. In Mongolia, he is honored as the nation’s founding father and even deified after his death.</p>

        <h1>Addendum for the Code</h1>
        
        <h2>HTML Structure and Tags</h2>
        <p>The document follows <strong>HTML5 standards</strong>, ensuring that there is clear structure and is readable. The <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> tag is used for the <strong>main title</strong>, while <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> provides a <strong>subheading</strong> on who Genghis Khan was. Paragraphs <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> break the content into <strong>readable sections which makes it easier to read</strong>. </p>
        
        <p>An <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag displays <strong>Genghis Khan's image</strong>, centered using <strong>CSS styling</strong> to maintain a balanced layout. The <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> tag contains a <strong>JavaScript-powered timestamp</strong>, dynamically updating the "Last updated" date.</p>
        
        <h2>Font and Styling Choices</h2>
        <p>The font <strong>'Ballet'</strong> was from Google Fonts and I chose it for a unique and historical feel, aligning with the <strong>Mongolian heritage theme</strong>. The <strong>background color (#360202)</strong>, a dark reddish-brown, reflects <strong>war, power, and historical depth</strong>, while the <strong>text color (#b68686)</strong> provides contrast for readability. The <strong>header text</strong> is light-colored (<code>#d4cdcc</code>) to ensure it stands out.</p>
        
        <p>To enhance <strong>readability and visual appeal</strong>, font sizes are adjusted for different elements. The <strong>body text</strong> is styled with <code>font-size: 1.75em</code>, making it easy to read, while headings are appropriately sized to create a <strong>clear content hierarchy</strong>.</p>
        
        <h2>Layout and Accessibility</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The image is centered</strong> to maintain a structured visual balance.</li>
            <li><strong>The text is spaced well</strong> to prevent clutter.</li>
            <li>Using <strong>semantic HTML elements</strong> (<code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;h1&gt;-&lt;h4&gt;</code>) enhances <strong>SEO and accessibility</strong>, making the content <strong>screen-reader friendly</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>This webpage effectively presents <strong>the historical content</strong> with an <strong>stunning font, structured HTML, and accessible styling</strong>. The design choices aim to balance <strong>historical aesthetics, readability, and functionality</strong> while maintaining proper <strong>semantic HTML standards</strong>.</p>

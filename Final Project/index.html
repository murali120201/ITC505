    <h2>📝 Addendum: Design & Development Reflection</h2>
  
    <p><strong>Project Overview:</strong><br>
      In this project, I developed a playable version of the classic <em>Lights Out</em> puzzle game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The primary goal was to create a dynamic and interactive game board that automatically initializes with a random but solvable puzzle configuration. When the user successfully solves the puzzle, the game provides clear feedback through a celebratory popup message.
    </p>
  
    <p><strong>Styling and Font Choices:</strong><br>
      For a more visually engaging appearance, I selected the <strong>“Barriecito”</strong> font from Google Fonts to give the game a playful personality. This hand-drawn, fun-style typeface has a friendly and casual vibe, which adds a sense of approachability to the game and complements its interactive nature.<br><br>
  
      The background uses a cool-toned linear gradient — shifting from a deep navy to a blue-gray — to provide a modern, slightly futuristic look that suits a logic-based puzzle. Hover and toggle animations on the board cells are smooth and subtle, creating responsive visual feedback when users interact with the game board.
    </p>
  
    <p><strong>Core Game Logic:</strong><br>
      Clicking a cell on the 5x5 board toggles its own state along with its adjacent neighbors (up, down, left, right). Instead of assigning random states, the board is initialized using a simulated series of valid random moves, which guarantees that the configuration is solvable.<br><br>
  
      The <code>hasUserInteracted</code> flag ensures that the “You win” popup does not appear unless the user actually interacts with the puzzle, preventing accidental win detection on refresh or during board setup.
    </p>
  
    <p><strong>Optional Features Added:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>🎉 <strong>Stylized Win Modal:</strong> Instead of a basic alert, a themed popup appears saying “🎉 Hoooray! 👏 Congrats, you win!! 🎉” when the puzzle is solved.</li>
      <li>🔁 <strong>Reset Game Button:</strong> Restores the board to its original randomized state.</li>
      <li>🎲 <strong>New Game Button:</strong> Generates a completely new, random (but solvable) puzzle.</li>
      <li>✨ <strong>Subtle Animations:</strong> Cells fade and animate smoothly when toggled or hovered, improving user experience and visual flow.</li>
    </ul>
  
    <p><strong>Challenges and Insights:</strong><br>
      The first challenge was ensuring random boards were solvable. This was overcome by simulating valid random “clicks” from a clean board, since each click represents a legal move — thus keeping the resulting puzzle always solvable.<br><br>
  
      Another edge case was the premature triggering of the win condition right after a refresh. This was resolved by tracking whether the user had interacted before checking for a win.
    </p>
  
    <p><strong>Takeaway:</strong><br>
      This project emphasized the value of clean, modular JavaScript, good UI/UX design, and user-friendly accessibility features like hover effects and victory animations. It also improved my ability to debug interaction-driven logic and maintain consistent game state across resets.

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>Photograph shows a three-quarter-length portrait of an African American sailor sitting, facing front, holding cased photographs toward the camera.</p>

    <h2>Created / Published</h2>
    <p>[between 1860 and 1870]</p>

    <h2>Genre</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Portrait photographs--1860-1870</li>
        <li>Ambrotypes--1860-1870</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Caption label from exhibit "American Treasures Memory": A Civil War Sailor. In need of experienced sailors during the Civil War, the United States Navy recruited free blacks and contraband into its ranks. It is estimated that 18,000 African-American sailors served in the Navy during the Civil War. Blacks worked on most of the naval vessels alongside their white counterparts and received equal pay, living accommodations, medical care, and pensions. This is an example of an ambrotype, a photographic process used for a brief period of time in the mid-1800s that placed a glass plate negative against a dark background to create a positive image.</li>
        <li>Title devised by Library staff. Title in the Gladstone collection checklist identified the people in the portraits held by the sailor as Confederate soldiers, but that has not been verified.</li>
        <li>Case Front: Rinhart 89.</li>
        <li>Case Back: Geometric weave.</li>

    <h1>Addendum of the Code</h1>
    <h2>Font choices</h2>
    <p>I selected the "Caesar Dressing" font for its unique and artistic style, which adds a creative flair to the webpage. This font choice aligns with the historical context of the content, providing a sense of character and elegance that complements the subject matter.</p>
    
    <h2>Sizes of Headings and the Main Text Size</h2>
    <p>The main heading <strong>&lt;h1&gt;</strong> is set to a size of <strong>4em</strong>, making it prominent and easily noticeable. This size establishes a clear hierarchy, indicating that it is the most important element on the page.</p>
    <p>The subheadings <strong>&lt;h2&gt;</strong> are set to <strong>2em</strong>, which provides a clear distinction from the main heading while still being large enough to draw attention.</p>
    <p>The main text size is set to a comfortable <strong>1em</strong>, ensuring readability without overwhelming the reader. This size is standard for body text, making it accessible for all users.</p>

    <h3>Choices of color</h3>
    <p>I opted for a dark gray color (rgb(128, 120, 10)) for the main text to ensure high contrast against the black background, enhancing readability. This choice minimizes eye strain and makes the content easy to digest.</p>
    <p>The <strong>&lt;h1&gt;</strong> heading is styled in a rich red color (#c04444), which draws attention and signifies importance. The <strong>&lt;h2&lt;</strong> headings are in a darker shade of red (#973333), providing a cohesive color scheme while maintaining a clear visual hierarchy. </p>

    <h4> Margin and padding choices</h4>
    <p>The body of the document has a margin of 20px, providing breathing room around the content and preventing it from feeling cramped. This margin helps to create a more open and inviting layout.</p>
    <p>Headings have additional margins to separate them from the surrounding text, enhancing the visual hierarchy. For example, the <strong>&lt;h1&lt;</strong> has a larger margin to distinguish it from the paragraph below, while the <strong>h2&lt;</strong> headings have a smaller margin to maintain a cohesive look.</p>

    <h5>HTML Abuse</h5>
    <p>In reviewing my Lab 2 page, I identified instances of "HTML abuse" where I had chosen elements based on their appearance rather than their semantic meaning.</p>
    <p>Title of the Essay: Initially, I used an <strong>&lt;h2&lt;</strong> tag for the title of my essay because it visually appeared larger and more appealing. I have corrected this by changing it to an <strong>&lt;h1&lt;</strong> tag, which is semantically appropriate as it represents the highest-level heading on the page.</p>
    <p>Subheadings: I also found that some subheadings were incorrectly marked as <strong>&lt;h3&lt;</strong> tags for visual reasons. These have been updated to <strong>&lt;h2&lt;</strong> tags to accurately reflect their importance in the document structure</p>
    <p>By making these changes, I have ensured that the HTML structure is semantically correct, which improves accessibility and search engine optimization (SEO)</p>
